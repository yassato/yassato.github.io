# Research

### **Quantitative Ecological Genetics of Biotic Interaction**  
I am interested in how genetic variation shapes, and is shaped by, biotic interactions. To analyze quantitative genetic variation in complex ecological traits, my research employs cutting-edge tools from computational biology and functional genomics. Currently, I am working on plant-herbivore interactions, but other projects involving biotic interactions are also welcome.  
**Keywords: Ecology, Plant-insect interaction, Genetics of complex traits**  

## Recent projects

#### **1. Plant Neighborhood Effects and the Maintenance of Polymorphism**  
Herbivory risk depends on neighboring plants as well as plants’ own traits. Such neighbor effects can exert frequency-dependent selection on plant defense when they occur among plant genotypes within a species (reviewed by Sato 2018 Plant Species Biology). My PhD study showed that the feeding preference of a leaf beetle mediated negative frequency-dependent selection on the *GLABRA1*-based trichome dimorphism of *Arabidopsis halleri* (Sato & Kudoh 2017 The American Naturalist; Sato et al. 2017 Functional Ecology).

![Hairy *Arabidopsis halleri* (left) and larval *Phaedon brassicae* (right) from [Plant Species Biology Vol. 33(2)](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14421984/2018/33/2)](./photo/psbi12186-toc-0001-m_coverphoto.jpg){width=50%}

#### **2. Quantitative Genetics of Plant Neighborhood Effects on Herbivory**  
Plant neighborhood effects are not always attributable to a single trait or gene. To dissect the genetic architecture of neighbor effects, I have developed new methods called "Neighbor GWAS" (Sato et al. 2021 Heredity) and "Neighbor QTL" (Sato et al. 2021 G3). These new methods are being applied to the analysis of quantitative trait variation in insect herbivory and communities on *Arabidopsis thaliana* accessions.

#### **3. Data Analysis in Ecology, Evolution, and Genetics**  
To untangle complex ecological interactions, my research often employs statistical tools. This experience enables me to not only develop new methods (Sato et al. 2023 Evolution) but also collaborate with other research areas (e.g., Nakadai et al. 2018 Oecologia; Shimizu-Inatsugi et al. 2021 Plant Species Biology; Takimoto & Sato et al. 2021 Ecological Informatics). Data from plant ecology and genomics are especially welcome for collaboration.

# About me

*PDF version of my CV is available [here](./cv/CV_YasuhiroSato.pdf)*

### Yasuhiro Sato  
During my childhood, I collected nymphal shells of Japanese cicadas over the course of ten years (Sato & Sato 2015). This early experience sparked my interest in ecology later in life.

I received my bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees from Kyoto University in Japan. My undergraduate studies were completed in 2011 at the Laboratory of Insect Ecology, and I received my PhD in 2016 from the Laboratory of Plant Molecular Ecology (Kudoh Group) at the Center for Ecological Research. My experience in entomology and botany sparked my interest in plant-insect interactions.

After earning my PhD, I completed two postdoctoral positions at Ryukoku University in Japan: one as an independent postdoctoral fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) from 2016 to 2017 and one as a junior group leader of the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) from 2017 to 2021. During my five years at the Laboratory of Information Biology (Nagano Group), I acquired skills in plant bioinformatics and functional genomics.

During my first postdoctoral position, I began collaborating with the Evolutionary and Ecological Genomics Group (Shimizu Laboratory) at the University of Zurich in Switzerland as an affiliated member of the University Research Priority Program of Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB). After completing the JST PRESTO program in Japan, I moved to Switzerland and joined the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich as a senior research and teaching assistant in 2021.
